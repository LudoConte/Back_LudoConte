      " About This Software  Axis Game Factory’s AGFPRO v3.0 – for PC, MAC and LINUX We just released version 3.0 of AGFPRO & Premium - there are a TON of new features, assets and functionality that have been added, giving users the ability to create amazing game levels and maps like NEVER BEFORE!! Major features to AGFPRO 3.0 include compatibility with Unity 5 for AGFPRO, Premium, Zombie FPS, Fantasy Side-Scroller, Drone Kombat, BattleMat Multiplayer, and Voxel Sculpt!  We have also added new character controls and characters in both the ARPG and Platformer Players!  What you will really see is the POWER and SPEED that comes with this update, allowing users to create lush scenes, filled with assets, foliage and other features and functionality. AGFPRO v3.0 is a comprehensive toolset designed to provide game developers and enthusiasts with a powerful and rapid level creation, terrain/vegetation editing, lighting and atmosphere system. AGF is an independent product that empowers users to create game levels and environments for many types of game genres, and the AGFPRO v3.0 PREMIUM version is also designed to work in concert with the Free and Pro versions of the Unity 5 game engine to allow further customization and game publishing. AGF runs on the PC, MAC and LINUX systems. AGF allows developers to rapidly create game maps, sculpt terrain and design levels quickly and easily. With over 1000+ assets pre-stocked in the warehouse, along with 48 pre-set themes and 8 sample maps, developers and enthusiasts can begin creating levels in minutes. AGFPRO v3.0 includes all of the necessary tools to allow users the ability to import AGF scenes into Unity3d Free and Pro 5. Please note that due to Unity's change in business model from free and paid versions to a subscription model, we have been unable to maintain updates to align with our development pipeline and business model.  AGFPRO works as a standalone product for hobbyists as well as for developers who work from Unity 5 through January 2018.  Be advised that if you plan to use AGFPRO for professional game development, there may be certain features in recent Unity updates that do not work. Creating game levels and maps in AGFPRO is easy and fun - now ANYONE can create their own quality game maps without having to program, model or animate! In order to use AGFPRO Premium (DLC), you must first purchase AGFPRO.

The AGF packaged games are NOT intended for resale. It’s about creating and sharing with all. As an option, the Packager will automatically zip the game(s) package for easy distribution and no installation is required for the end user to play – no installers are necessary for friends to play – just unzip and have fun! New AGF Scene Loader Features: The AGF Scene Loader loads the AGF Scene Format into Unity Free and Unity Pro Custom Images that are used on terrains now load into Unity with scene(s) created in AGF Any locked assets in an AGF scene are no longer an issue… The AGF/Unity Scene Loader skips any assets that are not supposed to load automatically Any OBJ files that are loaded into AGF will also be loaded into Unity Free and Pro Action Role-Playing Game Player: The ARGP Player provides users with player and camera controls that are genre specific for ARPG game creation Using the Internal Player, creations can be played in real-time to play test map creations The External Player allows users the ability to package and send their levels to others to play Platform Player: The Platform Player provides users with player and camera controls that are genre specific for Platform game level creation The Internal Player allows users to immediately play and test their game maps in real-time The External Player allows users the ability to package and send their levels to others to play First-Person Shooter Player: This Player provides the user with an FPS camera and controller, specific for FPS game level creation and play testing The FPS Player can be used with the AGF Packager to package their game levels to share with others This Player also supports Scene-Linking and allows users to share their AGF FPS game level creations with friends and link their maps together for endless gameplay! FPS Weapon asset packs are also included AGFPRO v3.0 PREMIUM AGFPRO + PREMIUM ASSET Packager – users are able to package their assets in Unity Pro and use in the AGF tool-set Batch Asset Processing Automatic Icon Creation Over 500 Source Art Assets and Samples are included for Premium users More Information on what AGFPRO is and what you can do with AGFPRO Users are able to create game levels and maps using the software and also place characters (provided with the software) to play and explore their levels with multiple player style options (Action Role Playing, Platformer, FPS) Just to be CLEAR – AGFPRO is NOT a game engine.  It is literally made using the Unity game engine.  AGFPRO is a real-time, RAPID Game Environment Development Toolkit and is made to be used in concert with Unity Free and Pro for level/map creation. – However, AGFPRO does NOT need Unity to run or create levels/maps. The scene files that users create in AGFPRO “Basic” and “Premium” can be imported into Unity5 Free and Pro using our AGF/Unity tools. By using the DLC we have already released for AGFPRO (Fantasy Side-Scroller,  Zombie FPS, Drone Kombat, BattleMat Multiplayer & Voxel Sculp), users are able to create playable levels with AGFPRO (only – not viable with Unity) with a variety of characters, assets, gameplay mechanics and special feature, “Scene-Linking” to connect game levels There are limitations to some asset packs “locked (L)” that limit the users from loading these assets into Unity.  All unlocked asset packs are free of copyright and can be used via Unity for redistribution per the terms of the EULA http://ttp:/media.wix.com/ugd/43457c_ee338ac5b4f644eb8b432518a8bb3d79.pdf The redistribution or “sharing” of the games users are able to make using AGF and DLC “Players” is a feature we are working on at this time and will be made available to users at no additional fee Users are also able to create and place specific game play mechanics that are provided in the software Full customization of your levels and maps is possible with AGFPRO Premium and Unity Pro, whereby users are able to bring in their own assets and models to make their games unique and further commercialize, making a complete Stand-Alone game Additional Questions RE: AGFPRO? If you are interested in making a complete Stand-Alone game with unique characters, models, assets and game play mechanics not provided in AGFPRO and  commercialize it for sale, you will need AGFPRO Premium and either Unity Free or Pro software If you are a development team using AGFPRO + Premium, you will need one seat per team member using the software, but we do offer studio discounts, so be sure to contact us for special pricing We have many schools all over the globe using AGFPRO to teach game development and design in the classroom, from middle schools to elite Colleges and Universities.  We have a basic curriculum available that instructors are able to include in their course curriculum and we provide additional support that includes software updates, access to DLC, non-Steam versions of the software if necessary, user support and special feature integration upon request and based on the terms of the agreement.  We offer special pricing for schools and we find that schools love using the software as it allows students the ability to create complete games within the limitation of a semester and is a great introduction to begin to interface with Unity3d, without users having to program, model, animate or script. \n"

       "' About This Game  THE THIRD INSTALMENT IN THE THRILLING AGAREST SERIES! Following the huge successes of the number 1 Steam top selling epic SRPG, Agarest: Generations of War and its prequel Agarest: Generations of War ZERO, Ghostlight are proud to release the massively updated sequel to the series, Agarest: Generations Of War 2! This sequel was previously only available on PlayStation® 3 but now comes to STEAM bringing with it a host of new features, visual improvements and an enticing blend of in-depth strategy and multi-generational storytelling! Agarest: Generations of War 2 is set in a parallel world to the previous two Agarest titles and has a completely new multi generational story and universe to explore.  So while existing fans of the series will of course see some familiar features and faces popping up, newer players will not need to have played the previous games to understand and enjoy this instalment of the story. …One day, the world was enveloped by a mysterious blinding light causing terrible destruction.  The central continent, from where the light is believed to have originated, fell silent and slowly, demons began to emerge and spread throughout the world like a plague. Sometime afterwards, a young man by the name of Weiss, suffering from amnesia, encounters the enigmatic Eva who tells him that he has committed the sin of deicide.  In order to atone for his crime he learns that he must become the \"Vessel\" in which the power of the divinity he slaughtered is to be stored.  This power will be used to resurrect the one whose life Weiss stole, for those who betray the divine will pay for their sins in the space which separates salvation and damnation, as will their progeny... • New Agarest Universe: Roam freely and watch the story unfold in this newly designed Universe and battle colossal enemies in over 80hrs of compelling gameplay! • Revamped Battle System: Engage your ultimate warriors in a new faster paced combat system with real tactical depth and a wealth of character customisation • HD Graphics: Enjoy the all-new environments, CGs and your favourite animated character portraits in stunning high-definition • Mini-games: Engage in Bathtub, Shiatsu, and Massage mini-games! • Soul Breeding Returns: See your favourite heroines evolve over several decades through each passing generation • Choose Your Path: It’s not just the heroines you unite with but also the choices you make that will significantly change the outcome of the story.
